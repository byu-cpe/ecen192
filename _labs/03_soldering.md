## Overview

Today you will be learning to solder. Soldering is when you join 2 electrical components together with metal to make a mechanical and electrical connection.


## Background/Preparation

**CAUTION! Solder is done by melting lead solder, the iron gets hot. Do not leave it unattended.**

## Equipment and Materials

- Soldering Iron
- Solder
- Wooden board to solder on
- Components
- Circuit board
- Mask
- Fan


## Procedure

1. Prepare the Area. Use a mask and/or the soldering fan. Do not keep any food or drink near you as the lead used to solder is toxic.

2. Heat the Iron. Most of the irons in the shop have dials with numbers 1 - 5 you want it to be about 4 or 4 1/2. If it has a temperature reading you want it to be about 350 degrees C or 650 degrees F.

3. Clean the tip of the soldering Iron with the brass wool that should be at your station. (This should be done frequently in between different pins to have clean solder.)

4. Hold the iron to the plate and lead of component for a second. You want to heat the pad and the component leads. 

5. Add solder to cover the hole. If done right you should only have to tap the solder to the iron. 

6. Give a few seconds to cool. 

7. Cut the lead of your component. 

8. Repeat 3-7.

9. Clean up station and make sure everything is off.

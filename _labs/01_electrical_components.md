## Overview

Welcome to your first lab! In this lab, we will be exploring many of the different components used to create various electronic devices. We will talk about what they do, how they work, and why they are useful to us. Because some students may not have full access to the CAEDM computers yet, the content of this lab is condensed into the powerpoint below. Simply follow along with your professor in class, or download the presentation if you want to see the pictures on your own computer.

Happy exploration!
